# EDA-Flight-Prediction
# Flight Price Prediction (EDA + Feature Engineering)

This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, source, destination, duration and more. The data analysis and preprocessing steps include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to prepare the data for predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

1. **Objective**: 
   - To predict flight prices using machine learning by analyzing the given data and extracting meaningful features.

2. **Data Sources**:
   - `Data_Train.xlsx`: Training dataset containing flight details and prices.
   - `Test_set.xlsx`: Test dataset for prediction.

3. **Libraries Used**:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation.
   - `numpy` for numerical computations.
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**:
   - The training and test datasets are loaded into pandas DataFrames for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understanding data patterns, distributions, and relationships between features.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracting key insights from date, time, and other columns to create meaningful features.
   - Handling categorical variables such as airlines, source, and destination.
